    "snippet" : "## 🤕 Problem\n<!--\n> [mandatory]  \nDescribe the problem we'll be trying to solve, the motivations and needs of the user. Mention other related issues and how they're connected.\n\n> Example: \"When an employer onboards a new contractor there are many factors to consider when engaging in a contractual agreement with the contractor. There is no automated way for an employer to implement a localized contract for their contractor onboarding process.\"\n-->\n\n## 🚨 Requirements and constraints\n<!--\n> [optional]  \nDescribe hard requirements (from product and engineering), if they exist. Add either the reasoning behind them or a link to where that reasoning can be found.\n\n> Example: \"The contract templates should be in HTML format, as this will make it easier to change and use version control. More info [here](XXXXX).\"\n-->\n\n## 💡 Proposal\n<!--\n> [mandatory]  \nDescribe what should be implemented: new pages, features, processes. If this is an epic that includes multiple issues, this is also a good place to link them.\n\n> Example:\n> - a new `\/dashboard\/documents` page for employers where they can see their documents\n> - a way for employers to add upload a new document, visible to other company admins\n> - an email notification for remote admins when employers upload documents\n-->\n\n## 🖐 Out of scope\n<!--\n> [optional]  \nDescribe what will **not** be tackled in this issue. If follow-up issues already exist, link them, so the discussions can go to their appropriate place.\n\n> Example: \"We will not be implementing document version tracking on this iteration, this will be tackled on this [follow-up issue](XXXXX).\"\n-->\n\n## 🎨 Designs\n<!--\n> [optional]  \nAdd a link to the designs (usually found on Figma). If the page that you've linked to has multiple screens, write down the name of the screens that are relevant to this issue.\n\n> Example: \"[Figma link](XXXXXXXXX). Screens:\n> - `Employer \/ Documents \/ Empty State`\"\n-->\n[Figma link](XXXXXXXXX).\n\n## 📋 Implementation details\n<details>\n   <summary>Show<\/summary>\n   <!--\n   > [optional]  \n   This might not exist when the issue is created, but can be filled during development. Add expected payloads, attribute names, which columns are sortable and other details that are important for the backend and frontend work to be synced. \n   > Example: \"Columns that can be sorted: `employee` (name), `creation_date`, `country` (slug)\"\n   > Example: \"Possible values for `contract_origin`: `remote_template`, `remote_generated`, `customer`\n   -->\n<\/details>\n\n## ✅ Tasks\n<!--\n> [optional]   \nList the tasks needed to deliver this solution.\n\n> Example: \n> * [ ] [FE] implement page to list documents\n> * [ ] [BE] add employer endpoint that returns documents\n-->\n\n----\n\/label ~\"category::new feature\"\n\n<!--\nRemember to add the correct labels for:\n- flow\n- area\n- product team\n- backend\/frontend\n-->",
